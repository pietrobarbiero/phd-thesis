\textbf{Research: in progress. Status: drafted. Difficulty: medium. Priority: medium.}

\textit{In this chapter I will showcase how my inventions significantly improved medical digital twin models~\citep{laubenbacher2021using}. First, I will descibe existing digital twin approaches in medicine and the main challenges of the field. Next, I will demonstrate how concept-based neural models can significantly improve the flexibility and robustness of existing equation-based approaches. In particular I will show how concept-based models allow the discovery of multi-omic patterns explaining drug responses in asthma and down syndrome.}
