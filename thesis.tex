\abstract{%
% The opaque reasoning of neural networks induces a lack of human trust.
Human trust in deep neural networks is currently an open problem as their decision process is opaque. 
Current solutions addressing this problem either (i) provide post-hoc, qualitative, and local explanations, or (ii) increase models' transparency compromising their accuracy.
To address these limitations, in this work I demonstrated how to design ``explainable-by-design'' neural models providing quantitative and global explanations without sacrificing accuracy. My key innovations enabling this progress are (i) a sparse attention mechanism and (ii) a high-dimensional representation for concepts learnt during training. On the one hand, the sparse attention mechanism allowed concept bottleneck models to solve each task using a small subset of relevant concepts and to learn simple logic-based explanations at train time. On the other hand, the high-dimensional representation of concepts breaks the information bottleneck of these concept-based models allowing them to gain accuracy without sacrificing interpretability. To make the proposed approaches more general, I devised an unsupervised concept layer which reduced training costs and allowed to train these models in absence of concept labels. As existing metrics were not always directly applicable, I proposed new performance scores to validate the impact of my innovations and to compare them with the current state of the art. The results of my experiments demonstrated how the proposed approaches significantly outperformed state-of-the-art models in predictive performance while providing accurate global explanations, thus breaking the current accuracy-vs-explainability trade-off and laying the foundations for human trust in deep learning.

% current limitations/knowledge gaps in XAI
% - accuracy and explainability
%   - visual (qualitative), local (instance-based), low-level (input-based), and post-hoc explanations
%   - interpretable models make accuracy worse (trade-off)
% - concepts make explanations more stable, but (1) require (expensive) annotations, and (2) do not solve the other issues
% my goals are
% - build models which are (a) more accurate and (b) more trustworthy than current models
% - provide models which (a) are explainable-by-design (i.e., they do not require a post-hoc external XAI method), (b) provide quantitative, global, and concept-based (high-level) explanations humans can easily understand and interact with
