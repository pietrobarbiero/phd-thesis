\chapter{Progress}
\textit{A report on progress made in relation to that described in the first-year PhD Proposal. This should include an indication of where the student is relative to their original timetable, discussion of any significant changes to the original ideas and their implications for the research as a whole.}

\chapter{Thesis Outline}
\textit{In this chapter I provide a tentative chapter-by-chapter outline of the thesis. I include a tentative title for each of the main chapters with a brief paragraph summary of their content. Chapter summaries also acknowledge the work I have already completed and the work I still need to do during the third year (for example, ``chapter written'', ``chapter drafted'', ``research complete but not written'', ``research in progress'', ``research not started'').}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neural networks: MLPs, CNNs and GNNs
    \item explainability~\citep{duran2021afraid,lo2020ethical,wachter2017counterfactual,gdpr2017,rudin2019stop}
    \item concepts-based XAI~\citep{ghorbani2019towards,kim2018interpretability,shen2022trust}
    \item limitations: weak metrics, no clear how concepts should be combined, accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off, concept annotations are expensive
\end{itemize}

\section{Concept Quality Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing metrics~\citep{yeh2020completeness}
    \item Oracle purity~\citep{zarlenga2021quality}
    \item Niching~\citep{zarlenga2021quality}
\end{itemize}


\section{Concept Embedding Models}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concept bottleneck models~\citep{koh2020concept}
    \item CEMs~\citep{zarlenga2022concept} break the accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off
\end{itemize}


\section{Logic Explained Networks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LENs framework~\citep{ciravegna2021logic}
    \item Entropy-based Logic Explanations of Neural Networks~\citep{barbiero2021entropy} provide excellent accuracies and explanations
\end{itemize}


\section{Explainability by Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encoding Concepts in Graph Neural Networks~\citep{magister2022encoding} discovers concepts in an unsupervised way (no need for expensive annotations!)
    \item Encoding Concepts in any network
    \item Multiple concepts
\end{itemize}


\section{The ``PyTorch, Explain!'' Library}


\section{Applications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item asthma
    \item down syndrome
    \item digital twin
    \item automated reasoning
\end{itemize}




\chapter{Timetable}
\textit{A timetable that schedules the remaining work and indicates when the draft and final versions of the thesis will be produced.}

\chapter{Papers}
\textit{A list of any papers published (with URLs so that the assessors can read the papers), a list of any papers in press, submitted, or in preparation, and a list of any presentations given, whether or not the presentation is associated with a paper.}
